My hubby and I are both Chartered Accountants and come from a family of entrepreneurs, so its no wonder that our daughter who just turned 18 is already curious about the world of finance and business. She asked me to guide her on how to start her investing journey and I handed her one of my favourite books on this topic – The Richest Man in Babylon - a timeless gem that imparts essential financial wisdom through captivating stories set in ancient Babylon.
My key takeaways from the book
1. Start thy purse to fattening:
 - Save at least 10% of your income consistently. Treat this as a non-negotiable habit.
 - Consider automating your savings by setting up automatic transfers to a separate account.
 - Over time, delaying gratification of daily desires will lead to long-term joy of building assets and wealth.
 
2. Control thy expenditures:
 - Create a budget that outlines your income and expenses.
 - Prioritize essential needs (such as food, shelter, and clothing) over wants.
 - Be mindful of lifestyle inflation—avoid increasing spending as your income rises.
 
3. Make thy gold to multiply:
 - Invest wisely. Explore options like stocks, bonds, real estate, or starting a business.
 - Diversify your investments to spread risk.
 - Educate yourself about different investment vehicles and their potential returns.
 
4. Guard thy treasures from loss:
 - Research thoroughly before investing. Avoid get-rich-quick schemes.
 - Protect your investments by understanding market risks and staying informed.
 - Consider professional advice if needed.
 
5. Own thy own home:
 - Homeownership can be a valuable asset. Buy a home within your means.
 - Aim for a mortgage that fits comfortably into your budget, still leaving space for the 10% saving.
 - As you pay off your mortgage, your equity grows.
 
6. Insure a future income:
 - Plan for retirement. Contribute regularly to retirement accounts.
 - Consider long-term investments that provide steady income in the future.
 - Balance risk and reward based on your age and financial goals.
 
7. Increase thy ability to earn:
 - Continuously improve your skills. Invest in education and personal development.
 - Seek promotions, side hustles, or entrepreneurial opportunities.
 - Confidence and competence lead to higher earning potential.
It’s amazing how the rules of wealth generation are so simple and timeless – Babylon was the wealthiest city of the ancient world ~4000 years ago, and the same rules remain relevant to this age.
